# UK Road Accidents Analysis

### **PLEASE FIND A MORE IN DEPTH DESCRIPTION AND GUIDE TO THIS PROJECT IN MY https://www.datascienceportfol.io/Owenjr PORTFOLIO**

This repository contains data and analysis for UK road accidents from 2005 to 2021. The main goal of this project is to explore and visualize the data to identify patterns and insights related to road accidents in the UK.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from two main sources:

1. **Accident Information**: This dataset contains information about the accidents, including accident severity, number of vehicles involved, date and time, location, road type, speed limit, and weather conditions.

   - File: Accident_Information.csv (672.77 MB)

2. **Vehicle Information**: This dataset contains information about the vehicles involved in the accidents, including vehicle type, age, engine size, and other vehicle attributes.

   - File: Vehicle_Information.csv (614.57 MB)

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The raw datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and facilitate analysis. The cleaned datasets are:

1. **Cleaned Accident Information**: This dataset contains cleaned and processed accident information data.

   - File: clean_acc_info.csv (582.77 MB)

2. **Cleaned Vehicle Information**: This dataset contains cleaned and processed vehicle information data.

   - File: clean_veh_info.csv (562.68 MB)

## Data Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes various data visualizations and analyses using Tableau. Some of the visualizations created are:

1. Accident Severity Distribution: A bar chart showing the distribution of accident severity across different road types and speed limits.
2. Accidents by Road Type and Speed Limit Box Plot: A box plot showing the distribution of accidents by road type and speed limit.
3. Accident Count by Weather Conditions: A bar chart displaying the number of accidents for each weather condition.
4. Accident Trend over Time: A line chart showing the trend of accidents over time.
5. Top 10 Accident Locations: A table showing the top 10 locations with the highest number of accidents.
